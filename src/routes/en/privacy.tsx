          <h2 id="m12">General information on data storage and deletion</h2>
          <p>
            We delete personal data that we process in accordance with the
            statutory provisions as soon as the underlying consents are revoked
            or there are no longer any legal bases for processing. This applies
            to cases where the original purpose of processing ceases to apply or
            the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this rule exist if
            legal obligations or special interests require longer retention or
            archiving of the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our privacy notices contain additional information on the retention
            and deletion of data that applies specifically to certain processing
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of multiple specifications for the retention period or
            deletion periods of a date, the longest period is always decisive.
            We process data that is no longer stored for the originally intended
            purpose but due to legal requirements or other reasons exclusively
            for the reasons that justify its retention.
          </p>

          <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
          <p>
            We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in
            accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the
            state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope,
            context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying
            likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural
            persons, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the
            confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling
            physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input,
            disclosure, securing availability and their segregation.
            Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise
            of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data
            threats. Furthermore, we consider the protection of personal data
            already in the development or selection of hardware, software as
            well as procedures according to the principle of data protection by
            design and by default settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology
            (HTTPS): To protect the data of users transmitted via our online
            services from unauthorized access, we rely on TLS/SSL encryption
            technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security
            (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the
            Internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted
            between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two
            servers), protecting the data from unauthorized access. TLS, as the
            advanced and more secure version of SSL, ensures that all data
            transmissions meet the highest security standards. When a website is
            secured with an SSL/TLS certificate, this is signaled by displaying
            HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their
            data is transmitted securely and encrypted.

              to our online offer is logged in the form of so-called
              &quot;server log files&quot;. The server log files may include the

              successful retrieval, browser type and version, the user's

              generally IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log

              the servers (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called
              DDoS attacks), and to ensure the utilization of the servers and

              incident.

              emails (e.g. the providers involved) and the contents of the
              respective emails are processed. The aforementioned data may also
              be processed for purposes of SPAM detection. We ask you to note
              that emails are generally not sent encrypted on the Internet. As a
              rule, emails are encrypted during transit, but (unless a so-called
              end-to-end encryption method is used) not on the servers from
              which they are sent and received. We therefore cannot accept any

          <h2 id="m328">Plug-ins and embedded functions and content</h2>
          <p>
            We integrate function and content elements into our online offering
            that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers
            (hereinafter referred to as &quot;third-party providers&quot;). This
            can be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter
            uniformly referred to as &quot;content&quot;).
          </p>
          <p>
            The integration always presupposes that the third-party providers of
            this content process the IP address of the user, since they could
            not send the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP
            address is therefore required for the presentation of these contents
            or functions. We strive to use only those contents whose respective
            providers solely use the IP address for delivering the content.
            Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible
            graphics, also referred to as &quot;web beacons&quot;) for
            statistical or marketing purposes. The &quot;pixel tags&quot; can be
            used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of
            this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored in
            cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things,
            technical information about the browser and operating system,
            referring websites, visit time, and other information on the use of
            our online offering, as well as be linked to such information from
            other sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Notes on legal bases:</strong> If we ask users for their
            consent to the use of the third-party providers, the legal basis for
            processing data is permission. Otherwise, user data will be
            processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in
            efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services). In this
            context, we would also like to draw your attention to the
            information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.

              of the font provider in the USA. When visiting our online offer,
              the users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google
              Fonts Web API (i.e. a software interface for retrieving the
              fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides the users with the
              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) of Google Fonts and then the fonts
              specified in the CSS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP
              address used by the respective user to access the Internet, (2)
              the requested URL on the Google server and (3) the HTTP headers,
              including the User-Agent describing the browser and operating
              system versions of the website visitors, and the referring URL. IP
              addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers and they
              are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP
              requests (requested URL, User-Agent, and referring URL). Access to
              this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL
              identifies the font families for which the user wants to load
              fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often
              a specific font family is requested. For the Google Fonts Web API,
              the User-Agent must adapt the font generated for the respective
              browser type. The User-Agent is logged primarily for debugging and
              used to generate aggregated usage statistics to measure the
              popularity of font families. These aggregated usage statistics are
              published on the &quot;Analytics&quot; page of Google Fonts.
              Finally, the referring URL is logged so that the data can be used
              for production maintenance and an aggregated report on the top
              integrations based on the number of font requests can be
              generated. Google states that it does not use any information
              collected by Google Fonts to profile end users or target ads;{' '}
